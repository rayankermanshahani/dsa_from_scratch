### time and space complexity analysis these string operation implementations

reverse_string:
- time complexity is $O(n)$ where $n$ is the length of the string because we have to iterate through each character in the string
- space complexity is $O(1)$ because the operation is performed in-place

is_palindrome:
- time complexity is $O(n)$ where $n$ is the length of the string beacuase we have to iterate through each character in the string
- space complexity is $O(1)$ because the operation is performed in-place

find_substring (naive implementation):
- time complexity is $O(m * n)$ where $m$ is the length of the main string and $n$ is the length of the substring because there is full looping through each character of both strings
- space complexity is $O(1)$ because no memory is copied 

find_substring (KMP algorithm implementation):
- time complexity 
- space complexity
