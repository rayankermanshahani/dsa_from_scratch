### stack data structure
- a linear data structure following the last-in-first-out (LIFO) principle 
- can think of it as a stack of plates; you can only add and remove from the top of the pile
- primary operations:
    - push: add an element to the stack
    - pop: remove an element from the stack
    - peek: view/access the top element without removing it
- practical uses:
    - function call stack in programming languages
    - undo mechanisms in text editors 
    - expression evaluation and syntax parsing 
    - browser history (back button functionality)
