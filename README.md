# data structures and algorithms (DSA) from scratch

This is my personal portfolio of foundational data structures and algorithms that I have implemented from scratch. This project is to serve as an attestation to my competence with important abstractions in modern computer science and software engineering.

Data Structures:
- dynamic arrays (vectors and strings)
- linked lists (singly, doubly, circular)
- stacks and queues (array and linked list based)
- hash tables (with collision resolution techniques: chaining, open addressing)
- trees (binary tree, binary search tree, AVL tree, red-black tree)
- heaps (min-heap, max-heap)
- graphs (adjacency list and matrix representations)
- trie (prefix tree)
 
Sorting Algorithms:
- bubble sort
- selection sort
- insertion sort
- merge sort
- quick sort
- heap sort
- counting sort
- radix sort
- bucket sort
 
Searching Algorithms:
- linear saerch
- binary search
- depth-first search (DFS)
- breadth-first search (BFS)
 
Graph Algorithms:
- dijkstra's shortest path
- bellman-ford algorithm
- floyd-warshall algorithm
- kruskal's minimum spanning tree
- prim's minimum spanning tree
- topological sort
 
Dynamic Programming:
- fibonacci sequence
- longest common subsequence
- longest increasing subsequence
- 0/1 knapsack problem
- matrix chain multiplication
- coin change problem
 
String Manipulation:
- string reversal
- palindrome check
- string matching (eg. KMP algorithm)
- longest common prefix (LCP) array
- suffix array and suffix tree
 
Miscellaneous:
- bit manipulation
- union-find (disjoint set)
- huffman coding 
- TBD.
